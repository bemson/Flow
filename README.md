# Flow
by Bemi Faison

version 0.5.0
(2/24/13)

Flow is an experiment for creating comprehensive, maintainable JavaScript applications. Unlike most frameworks, which provide objects to use in your code, Flow captures how you use those objects in your code. Flow uses a mix of declarative and state-based programming to deliver discrete code organization and unparalleled execution control.

During this alpha-stage of development, **the code remains undocumented**. Please review the test and source files for insights into the codebase. Thank you for your patience!

Older documentation and tutorials on Flow version 0.2.x are available on the [Flow wiki](http://github.com/bemson/Flow/wiki/).
